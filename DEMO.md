# ChatApp Demo Guide

This guide will walk you through testing the ChatApp functionality step by step.

## 🚀 Quick Start Demo

### Step 1: Launch the App
1. Run the app: `npm run android` or `npm run ios`
2. Wait for the splash screen animation (3 seconds)
3. You'll see the "ChatApp" logo with "Connect with the world" tagline

### Step 2: Accept Terms & Conditions

6. Tap "Create Account"

### Step 4: Explore the Chat Interface

## 🧪 Testing Multiple Users

### Create Second User
